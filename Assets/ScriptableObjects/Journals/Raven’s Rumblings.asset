  LogContent: "The raven is getting weirder. It keeps going on about  cryptic pronouncements
    about \"echoes of forgotten wars\" and \"treasures shrouded in dust.\u201D \n\nRecently
    it stuck on \u2018Shattered\u2019, \u2018Command\u2019 and \u2018King\u2019.
    \n\nTruth be told, a talking raven spouting poetry is starting to seem less crazy
    compared to the rest of this situation.  Who knows, maybe these poems are the
    key to navigating to shelter and getting ourselves out of here. \n\n One thing's
    for sure, I'm writing them all down.  Maybe back home, someone can decipher this
    avian Shakespeare and make sense of it all.\n"
