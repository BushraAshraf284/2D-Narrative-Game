  LogContent: "Abel found it squawking near a tree trunk.  (Abel insists on calling
    it \u2018Maleficent\u2019)  Anyway, this bird struts around like it owns the
    place, reciting cryptic poems about forgotten dangers and hidden treasures. Abel
    seems oddly taken with it, understands every word the metal feathered freak spouts.\n\nDon't
    get me wrong, a talking guide through this labyrinthine museum might be our only
    saving grace. But seriously, can you imagine explaining this back home? \"Yeah,
    so we were stranded on a toxic wasteland, and a talking bird helped us find spare
    spaceship parts.\" They'd probably lock us all up in the \"highly imaginative
    fiction\" wing of the asylum.\nStill, gotta give credit to the raven.It seems
    to lead us some where decent to camp. Truly, even to have someone to speak other
    than these three gave me some clarity.  Maybe this world is not as bad as it
    seems?\n"
